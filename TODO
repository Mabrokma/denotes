there are multiply defined labels in 201.tex.  Should look at these some time.

add flow charts to the end of other chapters besides just the first? Do people
think that this would work?

A note from Eric Woolgar re: first-order flow chart:
  Nice. One very small point: The chart is slightly more accurate if you
  also write the condition $a_1 b_2 \neq a_2 b_1$ in the box for the
  equations with linear coefficients, as the $a_1 b_2 = a_2 b_1$
  sub-case actually belongs the the $y'=G(ax+by)$ form.  
I'm not sure if the manual mentions this at all. Add to chart? Should
be in the text, at any rate
