Typesetting conventions
-----------------------

We would like to use automatic equation breaking.  Use "\no" to prevent breaking
when it the automatic routine becomes over-zealous.
\be ... \ee is for unlabelled equations which may be broken up.
\bel ... \eel is for labelled equations which may be broken up.
\bec .. \eec and \belc .. /eelc are similar, but try and stop all breaks.

MEmmett: I like the breqn package, but I would prefer to use
'\begin{dmath}' etc explicity instead of defining '\be' etc.

XXX: add descriptions of easyexample, example, solution, solstep,
enumerate*, etc here.
