201 lab manual
==============

During the 2008-2009 academic year, GAME hired Malcolm Roberts and
Samantha Marion to create a 201 lab manual.  The version of the manual
that they produced is stored in the 201.v01 directory.

update anything.

Typesetting conventions
-----------------------

We are using the breqn package to automatically break long equations.
use 
  \begin{dmath} ... \end{dmath} 
for numbered equations, and
  \begin{dmath*} ... \end{dmath*} 
for non-numbered equations. 
Use "\hiderel" to prevent breaking at specific points.  If you want to prevent
the equation from breaking in general, use 
  \begin{dmath}[compact] ... \end{dmath} 
or
  \begin{dmath*}[compact] ... \end{dmath*},
and you can then use "\\" (the normal line break) to indicate to breqn where
you would like it to break equations.

For writing multiple equations with, eg, the equals sign aligned vertically
for both a LHS and a RHS, dmath doesn't seem to work, and align puts things
on opposite sides of the page.  Use 
  \begin{align} ... \end{align}
for now, I guess?

XXX or FIXME: add descriptions of easyexample, example, solution, solstep,
enumerate*, etc here.
