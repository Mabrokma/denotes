A note from Eric Woolgar re: first-order flow chart:
  Nice. One very small point: The chart is slightly more accurate if you
  also write the condition $a_1 b_2 \neq a_2 b_1$ in the box for the
  equations with linear coefficients, as the $a_1 b_2 = a_2 b_1$
  sub-case actually belongs the the $y'=G(ax+by)$ form.  
I'm not sure if the manual mentions this at all. Add to chart? Should
be in the text, at any rate

2010-01-20 Variation of parameters can be used to solve some of the
first-order problems. Might be a nice exercise for the VoP
section. (e.g.: identify which ones work. Give a general solution.)
